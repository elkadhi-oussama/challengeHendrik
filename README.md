First of all, thank you for emailing me and giving me a chance to participate in this challenge

I am so sorry, but I am a MERN stack developer, so I work with ReactJs in client side and nodejs and expressjs in server side. I will share my code and instructions for running this project with you.
I would like to thank you again and wish you a nice day

To understand how this project works, I added a video titled "how to run the project".
